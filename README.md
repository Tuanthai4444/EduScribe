#Eduscribe

Eduscribe is an application geared towards creating speech to text 
transcriptions from audio files or through microphone stream input. 
The main goal is to create an easy to use application that can be used 
to help students with disabilities or schedule conflictions. 
In order to reach this goal, Eduscribe utilizes multiple ASR APIs from
major companies and cross references them for maximum accuracy. 
We also want to focus this in a way that would allow these students
to create a highly adaptable and customizable application.
